<h1>A Java Application that Creates Receipt for Items Bought In Shop</h1>
<h3>Build Approach</h3>

<p>1. Identify a retail shop near you (e.g. Achimota Retail Shop). 
2. Create a project (Achimota Retail Shop), package (Achimota Retail Shop)
and class (public class AchimotaRetailShopID{}) to contain (public static void
main(String[] args){})
3. Application should make use of the following: 
a. customerName, customerMobileNumber;
b. unit price of 5 different items sold by the retail shop
c. quanitity (number of items bought)
d. subTotal of items, totalNumberOfItems and TotalOrder
e. orderMonth, orderDay, orderYear; 
f. totalDiscount = 0.25 * totalOrder;
4. Create the following classes; 
a. public class CustomerID{} to get and set customerName,
customerMobileNumber.
b. public class PricesID{} to get and set unit price of the 5 different items.
c. public class ItemsID{} to get and set quanitity (number of items bought)
d. public class DateID{} to get and set orderMonth, orderDay, orderYear
5. Use instances of these classes to compute subTotal of items, totalNumberOfItems
and TotalOrder inside public static void main(String[] args){} 
6. Create the method createReceipt() inside public class
AchimotaRetailShopID{}. Format prices and subtotals to two decimal places
7. Call createReceipt() inside public static void main(String[] args){} to display 
the output below
